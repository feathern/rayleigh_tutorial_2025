    "The next step in the process is to identify where within the *gavgs* array our deisired output variables reside.  Every Rayleigh file object possesses a lookup table (lut).  The lookup table is a python list used to identify the index within the vals array where a particular menu code resides.  For instance, the menu code for the theta component of the velocity is 2.  The location of v_theta in the vals array is then stored in lut[2].  \n",

Moreover, the lookup table is unique to each file and is likely to change during a run if you modify the output variables in between restarts.  When running the benchmark, we kept a consistent set of outputs throughout the entirety of the run.  This means that the lookup table did not change between outputs and that we can safely use the final file's lookup table (or any other file's table) to reference our data.\n",
