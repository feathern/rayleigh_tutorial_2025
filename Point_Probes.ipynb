    "1.  It provides an analog to laboratory measurements where slicing and averaging are difficult, but taking high-time-cadence using (for example) thermistors is common-practice.\n",
    "2.  It provides an alternative method of slicing a model ( for when equatorial, meridional, or shell slices do yield the desired result).\n",

    "1  Specifying Point-Probe Locations\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "Point-probe locations are indicated by specifying a grid.   The user does not supply a set of ordered coordinates (r,theta,phi).  Instead, the user specifies nodes on the grid using the namelist variables described above.   Examples follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:  4-point Coarse Grid **\n",
    "\n",
    "point_probe_r_nrm = 0.25, 0.5  \n",

    "This example describes a ring in longitude, sampled at mid-shell, in the equatorial plane.  We have made use of the positional range feature here by indicating normalized phi coordinates of 0.0, -1.0.  Rayleigh intreprets this as an instruction to sample all phi coordinates.\n",

    "2  Point-Probe Caching\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing sparse spatial sampling using point-probes, it may be desireable to output with a high-time cadence.  As this may cause disk-access patterns characterized by frequent, small writes, the point-probes are programmed with a caching feature.  This feature is activated by specifing the **point_probe_cache_size** variable in the output namelist.\n",
    "\n",
    "This variable determines how many time-samples are saved in memory before a write is performed.  Its default value is 1, which means that the disk is accessed with a frequency of **point_probe_frequency**.  If the cache size is set to 10 (say), then samples are still peformed at **point_probe_frequency** but they are only written to disk after 10 have been collected in memory.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:**  Be sure that **point_probe_cache_size** divides evenly into **point_probe_nrec**.\n",

    "3  Example:  Force-Balance with Point Probes\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Our example input file specifies a coarse, six-point grid.  Examining the *main_input* file, we see that all variables necessary to examine the force balance in each direction have been specified:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note that the pressure force appears to be missing.** This is not an oversight.  The diagnostic nature of the Pressure equation in incompressible/anelastic models, coupled with the second-order Crank-Nicolson time-stepping scheme, means that the pressure field can exhibit an even/odd sawtoothing in time.  The *effective* pressure force (as implemented through the Crank-Nicolson scheme) is always a weighted average over two time steps **and is always well-resolved in time**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When sampling at regular intervals as we have here, if we directly sample the pressure force, we will sample either the high or low end of the sawtooth envelope, and the force balance will be off by a large factor.  The easiest fix is to output the velocity field and compute its time derivative.  This, in tandem with the sum of all other forces, can be used to calculate the effective pressure as a post-processing step.  The (undesireable)  alternative is to output once every time step and compute the effective pressure using the Crank-Nicolson weighting.    \n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate how to compute the effective pressure force via post-processing in the example below."
